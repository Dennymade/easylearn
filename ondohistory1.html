        A Brief History of  Ondo State
        </center></h1>
<p> <h2>1. A brief background of the State </h2> <br />
Ondo State is  generally referred to as the <b> Sunshine State </b>. Before its creation, the State existed as the Ondo Province of the old Western State. The present Ondo State was  created from the defunct Western State on 3rd February, 1976.  Ekiti State was carved out of it in October 1996. The State has a land area of approximately 15,317sq kilometers representing 1.66 percent of the total surface area of Nigeria. The population of the State in the 1991 census figures was 2,249,548 while the  year 2006 census puts the population at 3,441,024 made up of 1,745,058 males and 1,715,820 females representing 50.42% and 49.58%, respectively. Ondo State has the longest coastline in Nigeria with considerable territorial waters offshore, rich in aquatic and mineral resources of significant quantity.
</p>
<p> <h2> 2. Geography </h2> <br />
Ondo State is located within Latitude 50 45&#39; and 70 52&#39;N and Longitudes 4020&#39; and 6005&#39; E.  The Administrative capital is Akure city while there are 18 Local Government Areas in the State. The State is bounded in the North by Ekiti and Kogi States, in the East by Edo State, on the West by Osun and Ogun States and in the South by the Atlantic Ocean. Ondo State is located entirely within the tropics.
The tropical climate of the State is broadly of two seasons:  rainy season (April-October) and dry season (November&#8212; March).  The temperature throughout the year ranges between 21oC to 29oC and humidity is relatively high.  The annual rainfall varies from 2,000mm in the southern areas to 1,150mm in the northern areas.  The State enjoys luxuriant vegetation with high forest zone (rain forest) in the south and sub-savannah forest in the northern fringe.<br />
The geology of the State is made up of the basement complex. The basement complex is essentially non-porous and water can only be found in the crevices of the complex. The rock types include quartz, gneisses and schists. This basement complex primarily underlies the sedimentary layers which consist of cretaceous, tertiary and quaternary sediments deposited in the coastal basin.
<p> <h2>3. Economy</h2><br/>
The State&#39;s Economy is basically agrarian with large scale production of cocoa, palm produce and rubber. Other crops like maize, Kolanut, yam and cassava are produced in large quantities. 65% percent of the State &#39;s labour force is in the agriculture sub-sector. 
The State is also blessed with very rich forest resources where some of the most exotic timber in Nigeria abound.
Ondo State is equally blessed with extensive deposits of crude oil, bitumen, glass sand, kaolin, granites and limestone. Therefore, the State has great potentials for rapid industrial growth in view of its raw materials base.  The tourism potentials of the State is also high as its historical sites, long coastline, lakes, forest and cultural events can be developed for tourism. The fact that Ondo State is arguably the most Peaceful State in the Oil Rich Niger-Delta region, made her the most viable investment destination of all times.
